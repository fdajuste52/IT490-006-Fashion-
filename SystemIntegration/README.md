### NOTES
- docker-compose 2.1 used to be able to wait for rabbit spin up (more in the file)
- alpine linux images are used for smaller images to be downloaded
- rabbit management available on http://localhost:15672 (guest/guest login)
- inter container connectivity is available via docker container names as hostnames
- python and node scripts are just for example to demonstrate working connectivity
